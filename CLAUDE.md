# Blog Extractor - Professional Blog Migration Tool

Production-ready tool to extract blog posts from **any blog platform** and convert them to WordPress XML, JSON, or CSV formats with comprehensive features including duplicate detection, retry logic, platform auto-detection, long URL preservation, and real-time progress tracking.

## Supported Platforms

This tool works with **virtually any blog platform** including:

### ✅ Fully Tested & Optimized

   - `output/extracted_links.txt` - All hyperlinks from blog content

### Option 3: Command Line

1. Add URLs to `urls.txt` (one per line)
2. Run: `blog-extractor-env/Scripts/python.exe extract.py` (Windows) or `blog-extractor-env/bin/python extract.py` (Mac/Linux)

blog-extractor-env\Scripts\streamlit run streamlit_app.py

# Easy batch file
run_extractor.bat

# Basic extraction (WordPress XML)
blog-extractor-env\Scripts\python.exe extract.py

# Concurrent processing (3-5x faster!)
blog-extractor-env\Scripts\python.exe extract.py --concurrent 5

# All formats (XML, JSON, CSV) for CLI users
blog-extractor-env\Scripts\python.exe extract.py --format all --concurrent 5

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+** installed
2. **Virtual environment** with dependencies installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. **urls.txt file** with blog URLs (one per line)
4. **Playwright browser** installed (`playwright install chromium`) - optional but recommended for JavaScript-heavy sites

## Troubleshooting

**"Virtual environment not found"**: Make sure `blog-extractor-env/` folder exists with Python installed

**"urls.txt not found"**: Create a text file named `urls.txt` with your blog URLs

**"No URLs to process"**: Check that URLs in `urls.txt` start with `http` or `https`

**"Import fails in WordPress"**: Ensure WordPress allows file uploads and try importing smaller batches

**"URLs are truncated in WordPress"**: This has been fixed! Make sure you're using the latest version with `soup.decode(formatter="minimal")`

**"Playwright not available"**: The tool will fall back to requests library, but some JavaScript-heavy sites may not work
