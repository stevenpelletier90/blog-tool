# Blog Extractor - Professional Blog Migration Tool

Production-ready tool to extract blog posts from Wix, Webflow, and other platforms, converting them to WordPress XML, JSON, or CSV formats with comprehensive features including duplicate detection, retry logic, platform auto-detection, and real-time progress tracking.

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Easy Batch File (Recommended)

1. Add URLs to `urls.txt` (one per line)
2. Double-click `run_extractor.bat`
3. Find output in:
   - `output/blog_posts.xml` - WordPress XML for import
   - `output/extracted_links.txt` - All hyperlinks from blog content

### Option 2: Command Line

1. Add URLs to `urls.txt` (one per line)
2. Run: `blog-extractor-env/Scripts/python.exe extract.py`
3. Check the `output/` folder for results

## Key Features

### ✅ Advanced Extraction Engine

- **Smart fetching** - Uses Playwright locally (if available), falls back to requests for cloud deployment
- **Cloud-ready** - Optimized for Streamlit Cloud deployment without Playwright dependencies
- **Platform auto-detection** - Automatically detects Wix, Webflow, WordPress, Medium, Squarespace, Blogger, or Generic
- **Duplicate detection** - Content hashing prevents processing the same post twice
- **Smart logging** - Professional logging system with callback support for UI integration
- **Content-focused link extraction** - Only gets links from blog content (not navigation/menus)
- **3-retry backoff** - Exponential backoff retry logic for reliable extraction

### ✅ Rich Data Extraction

- **Complete blog data** - Title, content, author, date, categories, tags, platform
- **Character count** - Shows content length for each post
- **Hyperlink extraction** - All links within blog content with text and URLs
- **Gutenberg blocks** - Properly formatted WordPress blocks
- **Unicode normalization** - Handles special characters correctly

### ✅ WordPress-Ready Export

- **WordPress XML (WXR)** - Direct import to WordPress with proper formatting
- **Links export** - Separate txt file with all hyperlinks by post
- **Proper encoding** - Handles special characters and HTML correctly
- **Gutenberg blocks** - Properly formatted WordPress blocks

### ✅ Professional CLI

- **Argparse interface** - Full command-line control
- **Progress bars** - tqdm integration for visual progress
- **Concurrent processing** - `--concurrent 5` for 3-5x speed boost!
- **Format selection** - `--format xml|json|csv|all` (CLI only)
- **Configurable** - `--delay`, `--retries`, `--verbose`, `--quiet`
- **Exit codes** - Proper success/failure reporting

### ✅ Beautiful Streamlit UI

- **Web interface** - User-friendly browser-based UI with clean, simple design
- **Real-time progress** - Live updates showing extraction status
- **Concurrent mode** - Checkbox + slider for 3-5x speed boost
- **WordPress XML export** - Optimized for WordPress migration
- **Link analysis** - Internal vs external link detection
- **Find/Replace** - Modify domain names before export
- **Progress tracking** - Visual progress bars with statistics
- **Download buttons** - Instant download of XML and extracted links

## File Structure

- `blog_extractor.py` - Core extraction engine (Playwright-powered)
- `extract.py` - Simple CLI wrapper
- `urls.txt` - Input URLs (ready with 40 Chevrolet blog URLs)
- `output/` - Generated files (XML + links)
- `requirements.txt` - Minimal dependencies (requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml, playwright)

## Configuration

Settings in `blog_extractor.py`:

```python
URLS_FILE = "urls.txt"
OUTPUT_DIR = "output"
REQUEST_DELAY = 2  # Seconds between requests
```

## Dependencies

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install Playwright browser
playwright install chromium
```

## Sample Output

```bash

## Run Commands

### Windows (Easy)

```cmd
Double-click: run_extractor.bat
```

### Windows (Command Line)

```cmd
# Basic extraction (WordPress XML)
blog-extractor-env\Scripts\python.exe extract.py

# Concurrent processing (3-5x faster!)
blog-extractor-env\Scripts\python.exe extract.py --concurrent 5

# All formats (XML, JSON, CSV) for CLI users
blog-extractor-env\Scripts\python.exe extract.py --format all --concurrent 5

# Custom delay and retries
blog-extractor-env\Scripts\python.exe extract.py --delay 3 --retries 5

# Verbose output
blog-extractor-env\Scripts\python.exe extract.py --verbose

# Quiet mode (errors only)
blog-extractor-env\Scripts\python.exe extract.py --quiet

# Show help
blog-extractor-env\Scripts\python.exe extract.py --help
```

### Streamlit Web UI

```cmd
blog-extractor-env\Scripts\streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

### Mac/Linux

```bash
# CLI - Basic WordPress XML extraction
blog-extractor-env/bin/python extract.py

# CLI - Concurrent processing for speed
blog-extractor-env/bin/python extract.py --concurrent 5

# Streamlit Web UI
blog-extractor-env/bin/streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Prerequisites

1. **Virtual environment** with dependencies installed
2. **urls.txt file** with blog URLs (one per line)
3. **Playwright browser** installed (`playwright install chromium`)

## Troubleshooting

**"Virtual environment not found"**: Make sure `blog-extractor-env/` folder exists with Python installed

**"urls.txt not found"**: Create a text file named `urls.txt` with your blog URLs

**"No URLs to process"**: Check that URLs in `urls.txt` start with `http` or `https`

**Import fails in WordPress**: Ensure WordPress allows file uploads and try importing smaller batches

## Technical Notes

- **Async Playwright** - 3-retry exponential backoff, concurrent processing with asyncio.gather()
- **Semaphore rate limiting** - Prevents overwhelming servers (max 5-10 concurrent recommended)
- **Content hashing** - MD5-based duplicate detection prevents redundant processing
- **Platform detection** - Auto-detects 6 major platforms using meta tags and class patterns
- **Logging system** - Professional logging with callback support for UI integration
- **Type-safe** - Full type hints, zero Pylance errors
- **Gutenberg blocks** - WordPress block format with proper HTML structure
- **Unicode normalization** - Handles smart quotes, em dashes, accented characters
- **Refactored architecture** - Small, focused methods for maintainability
- **Export formats** - XML (WordPress WXR 1.2), JSON/CSV available in CLI only
- **Progress tracking** - tqdm for CLI, real-time updates for Streamlit
- **Performance** - Concurrent mode: 40 URLs in ~15-20 seconds vs ~80 seconds sequential
